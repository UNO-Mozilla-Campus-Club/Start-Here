# How to contribute

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help this project come to fruition.

We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [UNO Campus Club Vision](MISSION.md) tells you where we are,
  * [Our roadmap](ROADMAP.md) is the 10k foot view of where we're going, and
  * Coming Soon - Mailing list: Join our [mailing list]()
  * Coming Soon - Slack or Discourse

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to UNO-Mozilla-Club](https://github.com/UNO-Mozilla-Club/UNO-Mozilla-Club.git) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding and Document conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

### Terminology We Use

[coming soon]

Thanks,
UNO Mozilla Club Board
