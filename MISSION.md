## UNO Mozilla Club

Vision: To work with College students and Instructors at the University of Nebraska to promote and teach open source practices and ideology to build and innovate the open web.

## Project Description
Our vision is to work with students and instructors at the University of Nebraska at Omaha to promote and teach open source practices and ideas to build and innovate the open internet. To accomplish our vision, the club focuses on three areas - curriculum, project engagement, and open source evangelism.
### Curriculum
We develop presentations, curriculum and activities to introduce students to open source processes and technologies.
### Project Engagement
We build the open internet by contributing to open source projects.
### Open Source Evangelism
We promote an open internet by sponsoring and taking part in events that encourage open ideologies, including - accessibility, diversity, shared knowledge, and collaboration.
## Real World Applications
Open source technologies have become very important to our digital infrastructure. Much of the software and hardware we all use on a daily basis is built using open source technology or is dependant upon open source technology. Corporations employ people to work in open source and often hire people based on open source engagement. Open source engagement provides real world experiences and introduces students to important technologies that can help them in their future careers.
