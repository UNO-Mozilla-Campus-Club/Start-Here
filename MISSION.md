UNO Mozilla Campus Club

	Our mission here at the UNO Mozilla Club is to ensure the further development of open source projects! Everyday, countless projects are in active development and continously looking for additional support and we take pride in being able to deliver the best support possible. As open source developers, it is important to remember the each project is a team commitment. No single user should take all the credit or claim a project as their own.
